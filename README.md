# Crypto price prediction

Creating RNN models for time series forecasting - predicting cryptocurrency price, to be more percise we will use LSTM. The purpose of these notebooks is not, of course, to create models that will predict the actual price and makes us tons of money, but to show a simple example of using RNN to predict time series data.

- In the `BTC_price_prediction` notebook we are creating an LSTM model to predict the price of Bitcoin, and in this notebook you can find comments along the way.
- Meanwhile in the `Crypto_price_prediction` notebook we are using ensemle, where we use multiple models, each trained on different cryptocurrency, and this notebook is without any comments.
